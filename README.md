Analyzing bank data to determine total profit/loss, changes in profit/losses, the greatest increase in profits, and the greatest decrease in profits.

Analyzing polling data to find total votes cast, a list of candidates, the vote total per candidate, percentage of votes each candidate received, and the election winner.


The main.py file is in both the PyBank folder and the PyPoll folder, this file has the code for both analyses

The main_bank.py file in the PyBank folder has only the code for only the bank/budget analysis

The main_poll.py file in the PyPoll folder has only the code for only the poll/election analysis

Each of the python files has comments on where I got pieces of code/commands from
